# Care Phenotype Analyzer Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the Care Phenotype Analyzer's architecture, including its components, data flow, and design decisions.

## System Overview

The Care Phenotype Analyzer is designed as a modular Python package that processes healthcare data to create objective care phenotype labels. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### 1. Phenotype Creation Layer

The `CarePhenotypeCreator` class is the central component responsible for creating care phenotype labels:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Data] --> B[Data Validation]
    B --> C[Clinical Factor Adjustment]
    C --> D[Pattern Analysis]
    D --> E[Clustering]
    E --> F[Phenotype Labels]
```

Key responsibilities:
- Data validation and preprocessing
- Clinical factor adjustment
- Pattern analysis
- Phenotype clustering
- Label validation

### 2. Pattern Analysis Layer

The `CarePatternAnalyzer` class handles pattern analysis and visualization:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Care Patterns] --> B[Frequency Analysis]
    A --> C[Temporal Analysis]
    A --> D[Clinical Factor Integration]
    B --> E[Visualization]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

Features:
- Measurement frequency analysis
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Clinical factor integration
- Pattern visualization

### 3. Fairness Evaluation Layer

The `FairnessEvaluator` class evaluates fairness using care phenotype labels:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Model Predictions] --> B[Clinical Factor Adjustment]
    C[True Labels] --> D[Fairness Metrics]
    B --> D
    D --> E[Demographic Parity]
    D --> F[Equal Opportunity]
    D --> G[Predictive Parity]
    D --> H[Treatment Equality]
```

Components:
- Demographic fairness metrics
- Clinical fairness metrics
- Bias detection
- Bias mitigation strategies

### 4. MIMIC Data Layer

The MIMIC-specific components handle data processing and clinical score calculations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[MIMIC Data] --> B[Data Loading]
    B --> C[Clinical Scores]
    C --> D[SOFA Calculator]
    C --> E[Charlson Calculator]
    B --> F[Data Conversion]
```

Features:
- MIMIC data loading and validation
- Clinical score calculations
- Data format conversion
- Synthetic data generation

## Data Flow

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant PhenotypeCreator
    participant PatternAnalyzer
    participant FairnessEvaluator
    
    User->>PhenotypeCreator: Input Data
    PhenotypeCreator->>PhenotypeCreator: Validate & Preprocess
    PhenotypeCreator->>PhenotypeCreator: Create Phenotypes
    PhenotypeCreator->>PatternAnalyzer: Analyze Patterns
    PatternAnalyzer->>FairnessEvaluator: Evaluate Fairness
    FairnessEvaluator->>User: Results
```

### 2. Clinical Factor Integration

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Care Patterns] --> B[Clinical Factor Adjustment]
    B --> C[Regression Analysis]
    C --> D[Residuals]
    D --> E[Unexplained Variation]
```
