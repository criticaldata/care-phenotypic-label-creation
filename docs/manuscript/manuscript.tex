\begin{abstract}
Healthcare data collection patterns, particularly in laboratory measurements, often exhibit significant variation across patients that cannot be fully explained by objective clinical factors. This variation, which may reflect subjective decisions by medical staff, can introduce systematic biases in healthcare datasets and affect the validity of research findings. We present a novel approach to understanding these variations through the concept of "care phenotypes" - objective labels based on observable care patterns that reflect how patients are monitored and treated. We develop a Python package that enables researchers to identify and analyze these care phenotypes, accounting for legitimate clinical factors while highlighting unexplained variations in care delivery. Using examples from the MIMIC dataset \citep{mimic2016}, we demonstrate how care phenotypes can help researchers understand potential biases in their data and develop more robust healthcare algorithms. Our approach moves beyond traditional demographic labels for fairness evaluation, focusing instead on observable care patterns that may better reflect disparities in healthcare delivery.

\section{Introduction}

Healthcare datasets, particularly those derived from electronic health records (EHRs), have become invaluable resources for medical research and the development of healthcare algorithms. However, these datasets often contain systematic variations in data collection patterns that can significantly impact research validity and algorithmic fairness. This variation is particularly evident in laboratory measurements and routine care procedures, where the frequency and consistency of data collection can vary substantially across patients.

\subsection{The Challenge of Data Collection Variation}

In intensive care settings, for example, patients with similar objective measures of illness severity (such as SOFA scores \citep{sofa1996} or Charlson comorbidity indices \citep{charlson1987}) may receive markedly different frequencies of monitoring and testing. While some of this variation can be explained by legitimate clinical factors - such as illness severity or pre-existing conditions - significant unexplained variations often remain. These variations may reflect subjective decisions by medical staff about monitoring intensity, potentially introducing systematic biases into healthcare datasets.

\subsection{Current Limitations in Fairness Evaluation}

Traditional approaches to evaluating healthcare algorithm fairness often rely on demographic labels (race, ethnicity, gender) that may be poorly captured in healthcare data and may not fully reflect the complex factors influencing care decisions. These demographic-based approaches can miss important disparities in care delivery that manifest through variations in monitoring and treatment patterns.

\subsection{Introducing Care Phenotypes}

We propose a novel approach to understanding healthcare disparities through the concept of "care phenotypes" - objective labels based on observable care patterns that reflect how patients are monitored and treated. These phenotypes are derived from easily measurable metrics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency of laboratory measurements
    \item Regularity of routine care procedures
    \item Consistency of vital sign monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this work are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a framework for identifying and analyzing care phenotypes in healthcare datasets
    \item Create tools to help researchers understand potential biases in their data
    \item Provide methods for accounting for legitimate clinical factors while highlighting unexplained variations
    \item Enable more objective fairness evaluation of healthcare algorithms
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Processing Framework}

We developed a comprehensive framework for processing MIMIC-IV data, implemented as a Python package. The framework consists of several key components:

\subsubsection{Data Structures and Formats}

We defined standardized data structures for various MIMIC data types, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Patient demographics and admission information
    \item Laboratory measurements and chart events
    \item ICU stays and clinical scores
\end{itemize}

These structures ensure type safety and consistency throughout the data processing pipeline. We implemented robust data validation and integrity checks to maintain data quality.

\subsubsection{Clinical Score Calculations}

Our framework includes implementations of several widely-used clinical scoring systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SOFA}: Evaluates organ dysfunction across six systems
    \item \textbf{Charlson}: Assesses patient comorbidity burden
    \item \textbf{APACHE II}: Comprehensive scoring system for acute physiology
    \item \textbf{SAPS II}: Simplified acute physiology scoring
    \item \textbf{Elixhauser}: Assessment of 31 comorbidities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Functionality Implementation}

\subsubsection{Pattern Analysis}

Our pattern analysis implementation includes sophisticated algorithms for identifying meaningful care patterns in healthcare data. The system analyzes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal patterns in measurement frequency
    \item Correlations between different types of measurements
    \item Stability of care patterns over time
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clinical Separation}

The clinical separation component quantifies how well care phenotypes align with objective clinical factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical measures of separation between phenotypes
    \item Analysis of clinical factor distributions
    \item Validation of separation significance
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unexplained Variation}

Our unexplained variation analysis focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantification of variation not explained by clinical factors
    \item Temporal analysis of variation patterns
    \item Cross-sectional analysis of variation across patient groups
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fairness and Bias Evaluation}

We implemented a comprehensive framework for evaluating and mitigating fairness and bias:

\subsubsection{Fairness Metrics}

Our fairness evaluation framework includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Demographic parity analysis across phenotypes
    \item Clinical factor distribution analysis
    \item Treatment equality assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bias Detection and Mitigation}

The bias detection and mitigation system features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automated detection of systematic biases
    \item Multiple mitigation strategies
    \item Validation of mitigation effectiveness
\end{itemize}

    \item Low-frequency monitoring phenotype (20\% of patients)
\end{itemize}

Our fairness evaluation revealed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Significant variation in care patterns across demographic groups
    \item Strong correlation between clinical factors and care patterns
    \item Unexplained variation in monitoring frequency
\end{itemize}
